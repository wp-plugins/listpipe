The ListPipe Plugin for WordPress pulls Powerful Custom Content from your ListPipe account and inserts it into your posts.

== Description ==

ListPipe is a blog service that provides Powerful Custom Content written just for you. We use the ListPipe Content Generator to deliver your subscription content into your blog. The plugin we discuss on this page provides a secure, account-specific handshake with our content service and allows us to deliver your content directly to your blog. Please note that you must INSTALL and ACTIVATE (installing the plugin without activating it is not sufficient) the ListPipe plugin for WordPress to receive content from ListPipe (you should INSTALL and ACTIVATE the ListPipe plugin for WordPress before you create your ListPipe account). If you do not intend to start a ListPipe account, then this plugin will be of no use to you. 

== Installation ==

These installation instructions for the ListPipe plugin assume that you are already somewhat familiar with the operation of WordPress. If you are not familiar with WordPress then we suggest taking a look at http://demoblog.listpipe.com/. Pay particular attention to the following topics: `Login`, `Write A Page`, and `Manage Posts and Pages` sections (The videos can take a minute to load, but they're worth it the wait if you are new to WordPress.).

To install the ListPipe Plugin for WordPress, we suggest installing within your WordPress blog (using the native plugin installation system; assuming your server is set up for that) or via FTP:

=Installing from within Your WordPress Blog=
1. Log into your blog and open the Plugins panel on the left-side navigation;
2. Click the 'Add New' option under the Plugins header;
3. Search for 'ListPipe Content Generator' in the search window;
4. Find 'ListPipe Content Generator' in the search results and click 'Install' on the right;
5. In the resulting window, click 'Install' in the upper right corner;
6. In the next resulting window, click 'Activate Plugin';
7. Confirm that the plugin is in your list of plugins, and that it is active;
8. You are now ready to start your ListPipe account.

=Installing Via FTP=
1. Download the ListPipe plugin from ListPipe or from WordPress;
2. Unpack the .ZIP files to your desktop;
3. Upload the file titled 'listpipe.php' to your Plugins folder (typically located at /wp-content/plugins/);
4. Log into your blog and open the Plugins panel on the left-side navigation;
5. Locate the ListPipe Content Generator plugging and activate it by clicking the 'Activate' link below the title;
6. Confirm that the plugin is active;

Note: You must INSTALL and ACTIVATE the ListPipe plugin for WordPress before you create your ListPipe account in order to receive content. Installing the plugin without activating it is not sufficient, and will result in a failure.

Note: we always suggest that you use the most up-to-date version of WordPress with the ListPipe plugin for WordPress and that you back up your database before installation.

= Updating =

The best way to upgrade is to use the 'Upgrade Now' button on your plugins page (assuming your server is set up for that), or by following these steps:

1. Backup your database.
2. Deactivate the ListPipe plugin for WordPress.
3. Delete the old version of the ListPipe plugin for WordPress from your plugins directory (typically `wp-content/plugins`) via ftp.
4. Download the new version of the ListPipe plugin for WordPress from http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/listpipe/ and unzip it (Unzipping the downloaded zip file should produce a folder named `listpipe`), and upload it to your plugins directory.
5. Reactivate the ListPipe plugin for WordPress.
